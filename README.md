# Image-Projection-with-OpenCV
With the combination of static (background) and dynamic (foreground) frames, an illusion effect is created.

The main theme of this project is to create an illusion effect that shows the projection of a moving (dynamic) image. This is done by combining the static frame with dynamic frames. By frames, I mean the images that are created during video capturing.
